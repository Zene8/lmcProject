# Future Features for LMC IDE

This document outlines potential future features and enhancements for the Little Man Computer (LMC) Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## I. Core IDE Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Code Editor
*   **Advanced Autocomplete:** Context-aware suggestions for labels, instructions, and operands.
*   **Code Snippet Management:** User-definable code snippets for common LMC patterns.
*   **Syntax Error Squigglies:** Real-time visual indication of syntax errors directly in the editor.
*   **Semantic Highlighting:** Differentiate between instructions, labels, and data with distinct colors.
*   **Code Folding:** Ability to collapse/expand blocks of code (e.g., subroutines, data sections).

### 2. Improved Debugging Experience
*   **Visual Stack/Register View:** Display the contents of the accumulator and program counter in real-time during execution.
*   **Memory Inspector:** A dedicated panel to view and potentially edit specific memory addresses during paused execution.
*   **Conditional Breakpoints:** Pause execution only when a certain condition is met (e.g., accumulator value, memory content).
*   **Call Stack/Trace:** Track the flow of execution, especially useful for understanding `BRA`, `BRZ`, `BRP` instructions.
*   **Step Backwards:** Ability to reverse execution one step at a time.

### 3. Project and File Management
*   **Multi-file Projects:** Support for linking multiple LMC assembly files into a single project.
*   **Integrated File Operations:** Create, delete, rename files and folders directly within the IDE's file explorer.
*   **Workspace Management:** Save and load entire IDE workspaces, including open files, layout, and settings.

### 4. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)
*   **Customizable Themes:** More built-in themes (light, dark, high-contrast) and options for user-defined themes.
*   **Layout Customization:** Drag-and-drop panels, resizable sections, and savable layouts.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Keyboard navigation improvements, screen reader compatibility.
*   **Internationalization:** Support for multiple languages.

## II. LMC Specific Tools

### 1. Assembler/Disassembler Tools
*   **Reverse Assembler:** Convert machine code (numbers) back into LMC assembly instructions.
*   **Macro Support:** Define and use simple macros for repetitive code sequences.

### 2. Learning & Education Aids
*   **Interactive Tutorials:** Guided walkthroughs of LMC concepts and programming.
*   **Instruction Reference:** Built-in, searchable documentation for all LMC instructions with examples.
*   **Example Programs Library:** A collection of pre-loaded LMC programs demonstrating various concepts.
*   **Visual Program Flow:** A graphical representation of the program's control flow (like a flowchart).

## III. Integration & Extensibility

### 1. Plugin System
*   Allow users to develop and integrate their own extensions (e.g., custom visualizers, new LMC instruction sets).

### 2. Version Control Integration
*   Basic Git integration (commit, push, pull) for LMC projects.

## IV. Performance & Optimization

### 1. Large Program Handling
*   Optimizations for parsing, highlighting, and executing very large LMC programs efficiently.

### 2. Resource Management
*   Minimize memory and CPU usage, especially for long-running simulations.

This list is not exhaustive and will evolve based on user feedback and project direction.
